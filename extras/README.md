# Extras

Who said, that You cannot do crazy things using _God's eye_?

## Motivation

We wanted to show, that so tiny and simple tool can be so universal. As it is a microcontroller with USB connectivity, it's easy to flash new code to it! Therefore why not use it as any different boards like Arduino or NodeMCU? Lack of pinout may be annoying, but software side is fully compatible.

## Projects

Have you ever played tic-tac-toe on microcontroller? Yes, these projects will be crazy and completely unnecessary. But, why not? Can't we have a little fun?

## Compatibility

As we are using ESP-12F in our device, this code will work on NodeMCU v3 as well as on any ESP-12E powered board. Additional compatibility will be indicated at the top of the main sketch file.
